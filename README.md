# SchsTestApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Considerations & Decisions

I have considered member search test as public web application, therefore not implemented any security related function (login).

In the search function member card number feild is option parameter so user having the flexibility to perform the search. activity. without card number.

could not written any test for web application because of the time limitation.

## What we could have improved on

We should not have menu for Search result page and search result page should display once user click seach button.

we can add the login functionalty to the test application.

Need to write the test cases for web application.

Search member function we can improve allowing search with other properties also.
