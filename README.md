## Considerations & Decisions

01) I have considered member search web application as public web application, therefore not implemented any security related function (login).

02) I have used the template driven form approach to build the search formed, because the search form is a simple form  and there is no much validation Available.

03) In the search function member card number feild is option parameter so user having the flexibility to perform the search. activity. without card number.

04) Could not written any test for web application because of the time limitation.

## What we could have improved on

01) We should not have menu for Search result page and search result page should display once user click seach button.

03) we can add the login functionalty to the test application.

04) Need to write the test cases for web application.

05) Search member function we can improve allowing search with other properties also.
